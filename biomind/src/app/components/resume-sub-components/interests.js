                Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors with friends.
                I enjoy bike touring to hill stations, forest areas and temples.
                I was a volunteer to work with WWF, Ashoka and Kingstone to take surway in Jungle.

                When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies.
                I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the
                latest technologies around the globe in Electronics, Automobile, Space, Military sectors.
                I love to watch Youtube for PUBG, PC build, Unboxing and Cooking.
