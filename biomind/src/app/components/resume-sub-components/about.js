                I have been working as web developer since 2014. I’ve worked in different projects, from static websites to enterprise level web apps. Since 2016, I’m working with offshore teams and so I’ve faced many difficulties and learned most of the things by myself. So, I’m self-motivated and self-taught professional who like to face and solve problems.

                Since 2014, I’m working in Agile and Scrum methodologies as an outsource developer. So, I’m familiar with Zoho, Azure, Bug Tracker tools and etc. I’ve mostly used Git repos comparing to TFS and SVN repos. And I’m very good at the Environmental setup for the projects due to the remote and collaborative work. I would love to work with the in-house team.
